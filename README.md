# Shoot Demo

This is a tiny demo implementation of [Shoot](https://github.com/shootphp/shoot) and serves a reference implementation to play around with for my blog post on using Shoot for [lazily loading template data](https://dev.to/erikbooij/lazily-loading-template-data-in-php-with-twig-and-shoot-3gka).

## Install

Simply clone/download, run `composer install` and point your webserver at `public/index.php` (or `composer run` which will start PHP's built-in web server on port 80).
