# Shoot Demo

This is a tiny demo implementation of [Shoot](https://github.com/shootphp/shoot) and serves a reference implementation to play around with for my blog post on using Shoot for [lazily loading template data](https://erik.booij.me/lazily-loading-template-data-with-twig-shoot/).

## Install

Simply clone/download, run `composer install` and point your webserver at `public/index.php`.
